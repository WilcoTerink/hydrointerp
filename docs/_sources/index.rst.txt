hydrointerp - A Python package for 2D interpolation of hydrologic time series data
==================================================================================

The hydrointerp package contains a class and associated interpolation functions specifically designed for 2D hydrologic data with time series. Additional functions have been added to calculate historic ETo or potential evapotranspiration (PET) for comparison purposes. The core functionality is derived from the `Scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/index.html>`_ interpolation functions `griddata <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.interpolate.griddata.html>`_ and `map_coordinates <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates.html>`_.

The GitHub repository is found `here <https://github.com/mullenkamp/hydrointerp>`_
